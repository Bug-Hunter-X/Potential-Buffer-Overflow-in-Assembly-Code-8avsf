This repository contains an example of a potential buffer overflow bug in assembly code and its solution. The bug involves incrementing a value in memory without checking for bounds, which can lead to overwriting adjacent memory locations. The solution demonstrates how to prevent this issue by checking memory boundaries before any modification.
